# BowlingAlley
- This repo contains the codebase for Bowling Management Alley Program's original and refactored designs.
- The programme is originally written in Java. 
- The code is a Bowling Alley simulator, in which the system simulates a control panel with the functionality of adding a new patron, creating bowling parties, assigning lanes, keeping scores, displaying the pinsetter visuals, displaying the lane status and score, and a slew of other related features.
- The Bowling Alley's original design was provided with a high-level Software Requirement Specification
that detailed the system's high-level functionality. No documentation was available other than comments
in the codebase.
- We intend to reverse engineer the given codebase into its original design, refactor the original design, and
implement the refactoring into codebase in this project.
